Welcome to MasterMind!
    In this game, the codesetter sets a code of four colours (there are 
    six color possibilities for each of the four). The code-breaker 
    has twelve turns to try to guess the correct colors and their sequence.
    Each turn, the code-breaker takes a guess at the four. For every guess 
    that includes both a correct color and its placement, a black peg is 
    given. If the code-breaker has guessed a color that is present in the 
    sequence but did not guess the correct place for it, a white peg is 
    given. The game is won if all four colors are guessed in the right 
    order before the turns run out. 
    Good luck!
